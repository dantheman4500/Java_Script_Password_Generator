## JAva Script Random Password Gentator 

 I today am going to show you how to create a random password generator with the help of JavaScript code. I have already created many types of JavaScript projects but this is the first time I am creating such a system. 

 Random Password Generator is a JavaScript project that can generate strong and unique passwords automatically. I made a box in everyone's first web page. I have used a heading or title. Below the title is an input box where the password can be generated.
 ![The Password Generator application displays a red button to "Generate Password".](./Assets/03-javascript-homework-demo.png)

The unit password will be generated each time you click the Generate button. For this I have used JavaScript```Math.random```  and ```Math.floor``` method. There is also a copy button that will help you copy the sourcecodes.
